===================

## Created using HTML5 and jQuery 1.9.1 (Initializr)

## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, 3,000 Alumni Strong will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
